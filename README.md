#           <h1 align="center"> Dictionary At Your Fingertips</h1>
<p align="center">I created an Android application that leverages a free dictionary API to provide users with word meanings, audio pronunciations, <br>
        and phonetics. The app incorporates a calendar-based learning tracker to monitor learning streaks and allows users to <br>
        save word details to a Room database. Additionally, it enhances accessibility with TextToSpeech functionality, making it<br> 
        easier for users to learn and understand word meanings.<br></p>
